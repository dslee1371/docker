## Check confing
```
root@dslee-haproxy:~/Dockerfile/nginx-sample# cat /etc/sysctl.conf 
# sysctl settings are defined through files in
# /usr/lib/sysctl.d/, /run/sysctl.d/, and /etc/sysctl.d/.
#
# Vendors settings live in /usr/lib/sysctl.d/.
# To override a whole file, create a new file with the same in
# /etc/sysctl.d/ and put new settings there. To override
# only specific settings, add a file with a lexically later
# name in /etc/sysctl.d/ and put new settings there.
#
# For more information, see sysctl.conf(5) and sysctl.d(5).
root@dslee-haproxy:~/Dockerfile/nginx-sample# sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
```
## Change config
I added the following to /etc/sysctl.conf:
```
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
## I then restarted the network service and validated the setting:
```
systemctl restart network
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
systemctl restart docker

```
